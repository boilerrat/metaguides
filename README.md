# Metaguides


This repo is for the website https://www.metaguides.fun/.

It was created using logseq, which is a "privacy-first, open-source knowledge base that works on top of local plain-text Markdown and Org-mode files. Use it to write, organize and share your thoughts, keep your to-do list, and build your own digital garden."

In order to contribute to this repo, you will need to download a copy of logseq here https://github.com/logseq/logseq/releases/download/0.8.12/Logseq-win-x64-0.8.12.exe.
Then you will need to clone this repo to your local machine and import the graphs from the repo. 

The intentions of this website is to provide a resource demonstratin the Meta Cartel ecosystem, as closely as possible. The truth of the matter is Meta Cartel touches on every aspect of Web3, if you peel enough layers from the onion. This site makes a good attempt at mapping out the ecosystem, closest to the core.
It is certainly within the scope of this site to map the ecosystem as deeply as possible, however this will require more contributors to the repo than are currently contributing.

Metaguides is a Sub DAO, or a Chili Pod or Meta Cartel. It was formed in order to guide grant requests through Meta Cartel. This program was succesful in getting grants out however it was often slow and time consuming for everybody involved. Metaguides was no longer required to fulfill this function. Something that did emerge from analysis of many grant applications was the desire for many projects to simply be connected to the Meta Cartel ecosystem. With this, the Metaguides were able to evolve into a DAO that could aide in that service.

With that, the Metaguides began holding Twitter spaces to provide a public pulpit for projects connected to the ecosystem. The next project is this website. It is meant as a CRM of sorts, for the ecosystem and a visual representation of the "social graph" of Meta Cartel.

One good example of the beauty of this web site is in how it can used to organize particular links for projects in the system. For example, to get a list of all of the Github repos that are linked to the projects, you can click on the "Github" node in the main graph, to bring up the "Github" page.
